# Cryptography Systems

This code was written for my cryptography class as way to apply the things I learned.
The course itself was a math course, so we learned about the mathematical theory behind the systems such as 
rings, groups, modular arithmetic, etc. The code written here is somewhat specialized to the systems
we discussed in class and may have some variation from the "real" systems used in practice. 
This was for the learning experience (and to send encoded messages to my friends also in the class :) ) 

That said, this is not intended for copying for any other course. Plus, other courses may have variations.
If another student comes across this, I would highly recommend trying to implement these systems on your own.
It's very satisfying once you get it!
